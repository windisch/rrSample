* an attempt to get rapidly mixing Markov chains on fiber graphs
* can be used to sample from the lattice points of polytopes

This is work in progress and any comment is welcome.
An R extension 

* binomial edge ideals,
* parity binomial edge ideals,

and their permanental versions over arbitrary fields.
